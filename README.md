# **AI Search & Zero-Click Impact on E-commerce Performance**

End-to-end data analytics project analyzing how AI-powered search and zero-click experiences impact conversion, revenue, and funnel performance in an e-commerce business.

---

## About the Project

I built this project to evaluate the **business impact of AI Search and Zero-Click behavior** on an e-commerce platform using a real-world analytics workflow.

The focus of the analysis is to understand:
- Whether AI Search improves conversion and revenue
- How Zero-Click behavior affects funnel depth
- Where the biggest revenue leakage occurs
- Which segments (device, category, region) drive performance

This project reflects how I would approach a **real business problem as a data analyst**, combining SQL analysis, Python validation, and BI storytelling.

## Business Context

E-commerce platforms are increasingly adopting:
- AI-powered search
- AI-generated summaries
- Zero-click answers

While these features improve information access, they can also:
- Reduce product discovery
- Shorten user journeys
- Impact conversion and revenue

The goal of this project is to evaluate whether **AI Search is driving growth** or **creating hidden revenue loss through Zero-Click behavior**.

## Tools Used

- **SQL**
  - Funnel analysis
  - Conversion and revenue metrics
  - Segment-level analysis

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**
  - Data exploration
  - KPI validation
  - Trend analysis

- **Tableau**
  - Interactive dashboard
  - Business-focused storytelling

## Dataset Overview

- Session-level e-commerce dataset  
- Each row represents one user session  

The dataset captures user behavior across search experience, funnel stages, and revenue outcomes.

Key attributes include:
- Search type (AI Search, Classic Search, Zero-Click)
- Device
- Funnel stages (click, add to cart, purchase)
- Revenue metrics

## Analysis Workflow

### 1. SQL Analysis
I used SQL to:
- Calculate conversion rate by search type
- Analyze funnel drop-offs (click → add to cart → purchase)
- Compare AI Search, Classic Search, and Zero-Click performance
- Analyze performance by key segments

### 2. Python Analysis
I used Python to:
- Validate KPIs
- Explore trends and distributions
- Support and cross-check SQL and dashboard insights

### 3. Tableau Dashboard
I built a Tableau dashboard to:
- Track key business KPIs
- Visualize funnel impact
- Compare AI Search vs Zero-Click behavior
- Present insights in an executive-friendly format

## Key KPIs

| KPI | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| Sessions | Total user sessions |
| Orders | Completed purchases |
| Conversion Rate | Orders / Sessions |
| Revenue | Total sales value |
| Add-to-Cart Rate | Add to Cart / Sessions |
| Zero-Click % | Zero-Click Sessions / Total Sessions |

---

## Key Insights

- Overall conversion rate is healthy (around 10 percent)
- A significant share of sessions are Zero-Click, limiting funnel entry
- The largest drop-off occurs between Click and Add-to-Cart
- AI Search contributes more revenue than Classic Search
- Zero-Click behavior reduces product discovery and monetization
- Mobile contributes a large share of total revenue
- Performance varies by category and region, indicating scope for personalization

---

## Business Impact

- Improving the Click → Add-to-Cart stage can unlock significant revenue
- Reducing Zero-Click dead ends increases funnel depth
- AI Search is a revenue driver when it pushes users deeper into the funnel
- Growth opportunities exist without increasing traffic spend

---

## Recommendations

**Short-Term**
- Improve product page clarity and trust signals
- Reduce friction in add-to-cart and checkout steps
- Add clearer CTAs within AI and Zero-Click experiences

**Long-Term**
- Redesign Zero-Click experiences to support discovery
- Optimize AI Search behavior by category
- Personalize experience by region and device
- Continuously test search and funnel designs

---

## Conclusion

AI Search improves engagement and revenue when it guides users into the shopping funnel. However, excessive Zero-Click behavior creates significant funnel leakage. Optimizing product engagement and AI-guided discovery can drive sustainable revenue growth without increasing acquisition costs.
